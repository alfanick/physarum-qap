\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

Foremost, we would like to express our sincere gratefulness to Prof.~Jacek~Błażewicz for his guidance, trust and immense knowledge. His counselling motivated us during research and writing of this thesis.

Besides our supervisor, we are pleased to thank all the members of Laboratory of Algorithm Design and Programming Systems, especially Natalia Szóstak. Without them this thesis would not have come into being. We could not forget about thanking the rest of Poznan~University~of~Technology community. Over the years, their mentoring was an inevitable process which consolidated our life goals. 

Last but not least, we feel the need to express gratitude to our parents, families and friends. They ceaselessly believe in us and their labour formed each of us as the beings capable of expressing themselves.
