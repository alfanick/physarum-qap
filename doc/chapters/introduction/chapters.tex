The thesis is divided into five chapters and includes one appendix.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Chapter two describes the research conducted in order to better understand the problems. It is divided into two parts. The first one describes the physarum organisms characteristics such as a position in the hierarchy, basic information about the species, basics of operations, emerging behavior and previous research. The second outlines the quadratic assignment problem (QAP). It consists of a different interpretation, practical usages, current exact solution and current heuristic.
  \item Chapter three presents the algorithm, which will be proposed as the result of this thesis. It will be a pseudophysarum machine providing working metaheuristics based on observed behavior.
  \item Chapter four describes implemented project with the usage of the algorithm.
  \item Chapter five summarizes the research and is focusing on future work ideas.
  \item Appendix A includes a description of how the colony was kept alive.
  \item Appendix B provides the results in the form of tables.
  \item Appendix C extends the work with usage of the algorithm for simplified tests for Traveling Salesman Problem.
\end{itemize}
