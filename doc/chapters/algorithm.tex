After meticulous research on behaviour and abilities of \textit{Physarum Polycephalum} and acquaintance of Quadratic Assignment Problem field knowledge, we could proceed with design of the new algorithm. Initial concept assumed creating a Physarum Machine --- a method of computation made directly on the slime mould, where inputs are defined by positions of food sources and physical constrains and results can be read via interpretation of slime mould's movements and other behaviours.

Such machine requires specific placement of food sources and constraints which must be transformed from QAP input into positions on physical Petri dish surface. Initial positions of \textit{Physarum} colonies must be declared too. When environment for the experiment created, scrupulous observations of foraging plasmodium must be continously made --- one can use human observer or automate this process using a camera and image processing software. During the experiment input can be modified if the algorithm requires such step. In the end solution for the QAP can be distilled from the observations. General schematic for universal physarum machine is given on figure \ref{figure:a_machine}.

Such machine requires designing two transformations --- an input transformation and an output transformation. lorem lorem lorem
