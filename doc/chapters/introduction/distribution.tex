\section*{Work Distribution}
\label{section:introduction_distribution}

Both authors wrote the text of this thesis. The rest of the work was distributed between two co-workers in a manner described below:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Amadeusz Juskowiak conducted a research about \textit{Physarum polycephalum} and observed the behaviour of the alive organisms. He also designed and implemented the algorithm approximating QAP.
  \item Wioletta Różańska conducted a research about the quadratic assignment problem. She also implemented the algorithm approximating QAP and carried out comparative tests with existing solutions.
\end{itemize}
