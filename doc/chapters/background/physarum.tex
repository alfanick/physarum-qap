\section{Physarum Polycephalum}
\label{section:background_physarum}

The organism being a subject for this work is \textit{Physarum Polycephalum} also called the many-headed slime mould. It is a member of the \textit{Physaridae} family of slime moulds, in order of \textit{Physarales}, class \textit{Myxogastria}, phylum \textit{Myxomycete}, supergroup \textit{Amoebozoa} in \textit{Protista} kingdom. While current position in taxology is well defined, presented characteristics will justify why scientists used to have problems with classification of the Physarum \cite{stephenson1994myxomycetes}.

In order to make the thesis readable, terms \textit{Physarum Polycephalum}, \textit{Physarum} or \textit{the slime mould} will be used interchangeably as the subject is unambiguously defined.
