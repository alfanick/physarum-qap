\section*{Work Distribution}
\label{section:introduction_distribution}

The work was distributed between two coworkers in a manner described below:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Amadeusz Juskowiak conducted a research about Physarum Polycephalum and he observed the behavior of alive organisms. He also designed and implemented the algorithm approximating QAP.
  \item Wioletta Różańska conducted a research about quadratic assignment problem. She also implemented the algorithm approximating QAP and carried out comparative tests with existing solutions.
\end{itemize}

Next to these tasks both authors wrote the text of this thesis.
