The thesis is divided into five chapters and includes three appendices.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Chapter 2 describes the research conducted in order to better understand the problems. It is divided into two parts. The first one describes the \textit{Physarum} organisms characteristics such as a position in the biological classification, basic information about the species, basics of operations, emerging behaviour and previous research. The second part outlines the quadratic assignment problem (QAP). It consists of a different interpretation, practical usages, current exact solution and current heuristic.
  \item Chapter 3 presents an idea for a \textit{Physarum} machine and an algorithm, which are a key part of this thesis. It will be a pseudophysarum machine providing working metaheuristics based on observed behavior.
  \item Chapter 4 describes an implementation of the algorithm and thorougly tests its behaviour and capabilities.
  \item Chapter 5 summarises our research and gives ideas for future work.
  \item Appendix A includes methods of working with a living colony of \textit{Physarum polycephalum}.
  \item Appendix B provides detailed results in tabular form.
  \item Appendix C extends the work with usage of the algorithm for simplified tests for related Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP).
\end{itemize}
