The thesis is divided into five chapters and includes one appendix.

\begin{itemize}  
\item Chapter two describes the physarum organisms characteristics such as a position in the hierarchy, basic information about the species, basics of operations, emerging behavior and previous research.
\item Chapter three outlines the quadratic assignment problem (QAP). It consists of a different interpretation, practical usages, current exact solution and current heuristic. 
\item Chapter four presents the algorithm, which will be proposed as the result of this thesis. It will be a pseudophysarum machine providing working metaheuristics based on observed behavior.
\item Chapter five summarizes the research and is focusing on future work ideas.
\item Appendix A includes description of hardware-software platform, which is used for examination of physarum.
